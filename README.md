# Distributed Task Management System Using Raft Consensus Algorithm

## Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a task management application that utilises the 
Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. 
MySQL will be employed as the backend database to store task data. The application will 
enable users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks across the distributed system.

## Objectives:
- Implement a task management system with Raft consensus algorithm for distributed 
coordination.
- Utilise MySQL as the backend database to store task data.
- Ensure fault tolerance and consistency across multiple nodes using Raft.
- Enable users to perform CRUD operations on tasks via a user-friendly interface.
- Demonstrate distributed system principles and fault tolerance mechanisms through 
the application.
